The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

Using the Live data we have tried analysing 

1. Gender wise - How many Passengers have travelled in First class , Second class & Third class of Titanic .
2. Age Wise & Gender Wise - How many passengers have survived .
3. Age frequency with Survived & Not Survived was analysed
4. Class wise - Survival Rate of passengers was analysed.
5. Bargraphs , Histogram, Subplots etc were used for data visualisation
